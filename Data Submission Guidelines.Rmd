title: "Data Submission Guidelines"
---

All data sets must have the following accompanying documents to ensure that others can understand the data. Please submit datasets as a 'package' with the following additional files.

**Note:** Trawl catch/specimen data, CTD, and Rosette data must be transformed to the standardized [IYS Data Template](https://international-year-of-the-salmon.github.io/about/IYS2022_data_template.xlsx) and submitted with all required accompanying files noted below. All other datasets may be submitted in a non-standardized wide view of the data (every variable has it's own column), so long as it is possible to link this data with events from the trawl catch/specimen or rosette data tables using a common column such as an eventID or a combimation of station name and time.

Required accompanying files:

* **Supply data as plain text files:** (eg .csv, .txt) or common formats such as Microsoft Excel (.xlsx). Avoid formats that require special software. 
  - Indicate the time zone of date and time columns (UTC is preferred)
  - 

* **Data Dictionary:** This defines each variable (column name) in every table of your data. Include variable name, units, and short description if needed. Note that for Trawl catch/specimen data, CTD data, and Rosette the Data Dictionary exists as a tab in the Template Spreadsheet File. 

* **Abstract:** This information will appear as the summary text in the metadata catalogue. Focus on **what** variables were measured, **how** the variables were measured, and **why** the data were collected to inform your hypotheses.

* **Supplementary Materials** Describe thoroughly the field, lab, and data processing protocols used to produce your data. This could be provided as a Readme.txt file, a .pdf file, or previous publication(s) defining your methods. Optionally, provide any scripts that were used to clean up/quality control data, filter data from the raw data, or calculate values in the final data package. Optionally, include any literature referenced if it's published Open Access.
