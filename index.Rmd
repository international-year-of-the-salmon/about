Data Mobilization: The process of efficiently making data available for others.


What is required by IYS scientists collecting data?

1) Register the dataset you intend to collect by filling out [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1grJN_xPZScd4r-IgUK7v_jnCs5IGKhDDElTskt6qdAQ/edit?usp=sharing). 

2) Submit data to the IYS for internal sharing and publishing according to the [Data Submission Guidelines](https://international-year-of-the-salmon.github.io/about/Data-Submission-Guidelines.html).

3) [Create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) and email iys.data@hakai.org your username so that we can add you to this data hosting service and you can access and share internal data.

4) Keep track of where your samples are using the [Sample Tracking Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14fbK5XlhCUL7p3IaSdAjehEm64Myjlxt/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105664784039276814199&rtpof=true&sd=true)

The IYS Data Science team will provide the following services:

1) Create a metadata record in the [IYS Data Catalogue](https://iys.hakai.org) which includes minting a Digital Object Identifier that will make your dataset discoverable and citable.

2) Host early versions of data and manage internal access by IYS Participants on the [IYS GitHub repository](https://github.com/international-year-of-the-salmon/). Note: IYS participants may also create their own repository and upload data directly there.

3) Publish your data in a open-access, globally-integrated, domain-appropriate data repository. For example, biological species occurrences and associated measurements will be published to the [Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS)](https://obis.org). Physical and chemical oceanographic data will be published to [ERDDAP](https://data.cioospacific.ca/erddap/index.html).

Note: If your organization has a well established workflow or repository for mobilizing data to, let the IYS Data Science team know (iys.data@hakai.org) and we will be happy to integrate your institutional data publishing strategy as long as the data are open-access and follow an international data standardization scheme.
