<p>Datasets from the IYS expeditions are in various stages of being
published. A dataset status number (1-5) is assgned to datasets and a
FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) badge is assigned
when the data reach level 5.</p>
<p>Dataset status levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: Data only have a metadata record, no data have been
received.</li>
<li>Level 2: Data have a metadata record, data have been received and
are available internally to IYS expedition scientists but not yet
published publicly.</li>
<li>Level 3: Data have a metadata record and only a subset of the data
have been standardized and made publicly available in a domain-specific
repository.</li>
<li>Level 4: Data have a metadata record and a non-standardized version
of the dataset is publicly available.</li>
<li>Level 5: Data have a metadata record and the full fidelity of the
dataset is standardized and available in a domain-specific
repository.</li>
