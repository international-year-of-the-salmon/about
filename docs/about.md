Welcome to the International Year of the Salmon Data Mobilization (IYS) Portal. This site is intended to primarily be an internal portal for IYS participants to centralize access to documentation, tutorials, data summaries, and data products.

Data Mobilization: The process of making data available for appropriate re-use.


**What is required by IYS scientists providing data?**

1) Register the dataset you have collected or will generate by filling out [this metadata intake form](https://cioos-siooc.github.io/metadata-entry-form/#/en/iys/submissions). 

2) Submit data to the IYS (secretariat@npafc.org and cc iys.data@hakai.org) for internal sharing and publishing to the [IYS Data Catalogue](https://iys.hakai.org/) according to the [Data Submission Guidelines](https://international-year-of-the-salmon.github.io/about/Data-Submission-Guidelines.html).

3) [Create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) and share your username with IYS Data Scientists by emailing us what your username is at secretariat@npafc.org and iys.data@hakai.org so that we can add you to the IYS organizational data hosting service and you can access and share internal data before it goes public (according to the [IYS policy](https://international-year-of-the-salmon.github.io/about/Final%20IYS%20Data%20Policy_Dec132021.pdf)).

4) Cite datasets used in publications according to the recommended citation for each specific dataset in the [IYS Data Catalogue](https://iys.hakai.org)

**The IYS Data Science team will provide the following services:**

1) Review and publish your data record in the [IYS Data Catalogue](https://iys.hakai.org). You will receive a Digital Object Identifier that will make your dataset discoverable and citable.

2) Store and host your data on the [IYS GitHub repository](https://github.com/international-year-of-the-salmon/).
