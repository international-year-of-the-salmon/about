The ultimate goal of the IYS Data Mobilization Strategy is that all expedition data are able to cruise participants, and that data are archived in open-access domain-specific data repositories where they will contribute to globally integrated analyses. How and where data are published will vary by research domain, however a copy of every dataset will be hosted in the [IYS GitHub Organization](https://github.com/international-year-of-the-salmon). 

Please submit data before the deadlines noted in the [Data Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1srIlyZfNdtGQ4-W8Ch2FStLnn9U_wW5WIS5wQ1E62w0/edit?usp=sharing) by emailing datasets to secretariat@npafc.org and iys.data@hakai.org as a data package with additional files laid out in the Required Data Package section below.

### Required Data Package Files:

* **Data files** Ideally in the IYS data template, in .csv or .xlsx format with time zone indicated (UTC preferred), latitude and longitude in decimal degrees, and unique sample identifiers.

* **Data Dictionary:** Define each variable (column name) in every table of your data. Include variable name, units, and short description if needed. Note that for Trawl catch/specimen data, CTD data, and Rosette the Data Dictionary exists as a tab in the Template Spreadsheet File. 

* **README file** (.txt or .docx) with the following sections:

  - **Statement of Data Access:** When can data submitted be made public? Can all of the submitted data be published, or can only a summarized/aggregated view be published? Keep in mind timelines should be in accordance with the [IYS Data Policy](https://international-year-of-the-salmon.github.io/about/Final%20IYS%20Data%20Policy_Dec132021.pdf)

  - **Abstract:** (400 words max) This information will appear as the summary text in the metadata catalogue. Focus on **what** variables were measured, **how** the variables were measured, and **why** the data were collected to inform your hypotheses.

  - **Protocols**: Describe the field, lab, and data processing protocols used to produce your data. This could be the same text used in a Cruise Report if there is sufficient information to reproduce methods.
  
* **Supplementary Materials** Provide publication(s) referenced in protocol description. Provide any scripts or calibration files that were used to clean up/quality control data, filter data from the raw data, or calculate values in the final data package.

### Data Format

In all cases:

- Indicate the time zone of date and time columns (UTC is preferred)
- Report locations as latitude and longitude in decimal degrees (ie. 49.12345, -110.54321)
- Include columns that indicate from which specimen, trawl, station, or event the data relate to
- Include unique sample identifiers

See an [example data package to copy here](https://github.com/international-year-of-the-salmon/example-data-package/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Fill out authorship metadata for your data set in the [metadata spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1grJN_xPZScd4r-IgUK7v_jnCs5IGKhDDElTskt6qdAQ/edit?usp=sharing) to ensure appropriate citation for dataset authors.

Email data packages to secretariat@npafc.org and iys.data@hakai.org
