## Open Access to IYS Data

The International Year of the Salmon Data Mobilization Portal centralizes access to data produced by  research expeditions into the high seas of the north Pacific Ocean in the winters of 2019, 2020 and 2022. This portal holds summaries of data publishing as well as technical documentation and policies for project participants. 

For public data access, see the **[IYS Data Catalogue](https://data.napfc.org/)**.
