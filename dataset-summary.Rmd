title: "Published Data"
---

Datasets from the IYS expeditions are in various stages of being published. A metric of FAIRness (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) is used to indicate what stage the data are at. 

Note: 2022 datasets are not yet represented in the table below.

Dataset status levels:

- Level 1: Data only have a metadata record, no data have been received. 
- Level 2: Data have a metadata record and data have been received but not yet published publicly. 
- Level 3: Data have a metadata record and a non-standardized version of the dataset is publicly available.
- Level 4: Data have a metadata record and only a subset of the data have been standardized and made publicly available in a domain-specific repository. 
- Level 5: Data have a metadata record and the full fidelity of the dataset is standardized and available in a domain-specific repository.

A FAIR badge is assigned in the 'FAIRness' columns for datasets that have satisfied all the requirements of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data.
