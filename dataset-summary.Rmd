title: "Published Data"
---

Datasets from the 2019, 2020, and 2022 expeditions are in various stages of being published. A metric of FAIRness (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) is used to indicate what stage the data are at. Level 1: Data only have a metadata record. Level 2: Data have a metadata record and a non-standardized version of the dataset is openly available. Level 3: Data have a metadata record and a summarized, aggregated, incomplete or partial version of the data have been standardized and are available in a domain-specific repository. Level 4: Data have a metadata record and the full dataset is standardized and available in a domain-specific repository.
